This is a collection of known design patterns and some sample code how to implement them in Java. 

## Patterns

The patterns can be structured in roughly three different categories. Please click on the [:notebook:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) for a full explanation of the pattern on Wikipedia.
